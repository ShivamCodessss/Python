# Tuples

# They are Immutable, that means it cannot be changed or it cannot be update in future
# They are index orderd. which means you can access them in future by there indexing
# It can store different data types
# it allows duplicate data

t1 = ("shivam", 21, "Mohan", "parul", 22,3,454,123, "non=sense")
print(t1)
print(type(t1))

#  we can input also as a tuple for example
# t2 = tuple(input("Enter a name"))
# this name will not be change or update in the entire code
# it is used for like adhar number which reamin same or the author name etc.

# let's use tuple with indexing
print(t1[0])
print(t1[1])
print(t1[2])
print(t1[0:3])
# it will 0,1,2
print(t1[0: ])
