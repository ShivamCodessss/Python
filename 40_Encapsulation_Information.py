"""
Encapsulation
It describes the idea of wrapping data and method that work on data within one unit

This put restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the
accidental modification of data.

To prevent accidental change, an object variable can only be changed by an object method.
Those type of variable are known as Private Variables

The Goal of information hiding is to ensure that an object is always valid by controlling access to attributes
that are hidden from the outside world

PUBLIC, PROTECTED, PRIVATE MEMBERS

PUBLIC = ACCESSIBLE TO OUTSIDE WORLD
PROTECTED = ACCESSIBLE TO DERIVED CLASS
PRIVATE = NOT ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE

"""

Python provides conceptual implementation of public, protected, and private access modifiers,
but not like other languages like C#, Java, C++.

So, there are no keywords known as public, private, and protected in Python
