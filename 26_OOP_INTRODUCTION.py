"""
Object Oriented Programming
A programming style followed by the programmers, in order to create an extensive
set of software and applications

What is need for OOP

Major flaws
if a progammer want to use a block of code which is already written in a program
then the programmer has to re-write it

Everything is represented as an object has state and behavior
state means data
behavior means functionality

data are = numb - str - char etc
functions are = input, add , multiply etc

What is class?
A collection of data sharing common characteristics, attributes, quality or property
let see this with an example

                    A person (CLASS)
Attributes                                  Functionality
Name                                        walk()
age                                         sleep()
gender                                      eat()
occupation                                  work()
