# pyhton operator used to perfrom operation on values and variables
# these are standard symbol used for the purpose of logical and arithmetic operations

# arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations
# for example

a = 10
b = 2

add = a + b
sub = a - b
mul = a * b
divide = a / b
mod = a % b
power = a ** b

print(add)
print(sub)
print(mul)
print(divide)
print(mod)
print(power)

# comparison operators . it compares the values and it returns either true or false
# for example

c = 10
d = 20

print(c > d)
print(c < d)
print(c == d)
print(c != d)
print(c >= d)
print(c <= d)
